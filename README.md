selenium-samples
================

Sample code that demonstrates some features of Selenium 2/WebDriver.

The examples in this directory have been created for my talk at SeleniumConf 2012.
When time permits, I intend to add more code here and improve them. They are _samples_, 
not coding master pieces.

How to use
----------
Set up your favorite web server to run on localhost:8080. Put the files in the root.

About the files
---------------
All samples are JUnit tests without actually testing anything. They're also full of
System.err.println and other "console-like" constructs. The purpose of this was to make
the samples easy to run, but above all, easy to extend into actual tests.
Although it looks a little awkward...
